# 💬 Java Chat Application (NetBeans + Ant)

A simple **Chat Application** developed in **Java** using **NetBeans IDE** and **Ant** as the dependency manager.  
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles through a real-time chat simulation, enabling multiple users to send and receive messages within a shared chat interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 💬 **Multi-user chat** — multiple participants can send and receive messages simultaneously.  
- ⚡ **Real-time updates** — every message appears instantly on all users’ chat windows.  
- 👤 **Add new senders dynamically** — users can join the chat at runtime with their chosen names.  
- 🪶 **User-friendly GUI** — designed using **Java Swing** for an intuitive experience.  
- 🔄 **Message synchronization** — ensures all participants view the same conversation in real-time.
