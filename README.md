# 💬 Java Chat Application (NetBeans + Ant)

A simple **Chat Application** developed in **Java** using **NetBeans IDE** and **Ant** as the dependency manager.  
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles through a real-time chat simulation, enabling multiple users to send and receive messages within a shared chat interface.
